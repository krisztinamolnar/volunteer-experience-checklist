      Welcome to our International Volunteering Checklist, designed to enhance
      your experience with your volunteering program. By ticking off activities
      like exploring the capital city or practicing the local language, you can
      track your cultural immersion and discover new opportunities for personal
      growth during your volunteer journey.
